# spla2n-files

Repository to house Splatoon 2's decompiled binaries/files. Directory structure and tools are taken from [botw's decomp](https://github.com/zeldaret/botw)

# Building

Follow the instructions on https://botw.link, replacing botw's nso for splatoon's nso.

# DISCLAIMER
As of now, this repository is **not** meant to be a full-decompilation of Splatoon 2. This is mostly meant to help in decompilation of libraries for which Splatoon 2 has symbols for, such as [xlink2](https://github.com/Nitr4m12/xlink2). If you'd like to start a decompilation project using this repository as a base, you're welcome to fork it and tweak it as you like.
